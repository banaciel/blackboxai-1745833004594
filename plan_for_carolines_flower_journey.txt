Detailed Plan for "Caroline's Flower Journey" - Mobile Touchscreen 2D Platformer

1. Project Setup:
- Use the existing index.html file as the main container for the game.
- Include Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling.
- Include Google Fonts for typography.
- Include Font Awesome for icons if needed.

2. HTML Structure:
- Main container div for the game canvas or game area.
- UI elements: Main Menu, Quest Messages, Credits, Final Surprise message.
- Touch control overlays or invisible zones for tap/swipe detection.

3. Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout, spacing, colors, and typography.
- Design a cute, bright flower-themed aesthetic.
- Responsive design optimized for mobile screens.

4. Game Logic (JavaScript):
- Implement Caroline character with basic animations (idle, running, jumping).
- Implement side-scrolling platformer mechanics.
- Implement touch controls:
  - Tap left/right side to move Caroline.
  - Swipe up to jump.
  - Tap objects to collect/interact.
  - Swipe objects to build bridges or catch items.
  - Tap-and-hold for special interactions.
- Implement quests with objectives and reward messages:
  - Garden of Strength: Tap to collect 5 strong flowers.
  - River of Distance: Swipe lily pads to build a bridge.
  - Dreams in the Sky: Tap and catch 3 glowing butterflies.
  - Meadow of Hopes: Swipe up to jump across mushrooms.
  - Tower of Memories: Swipe up to jump and climb flower vine tower.
- Track quest progress and unlock next quests.
- Display reward messages after each quest.
- Final Surprise: Show secret glowing garden, heart-shaped flower, final birthday message, and flower petal fireworks animation.

5. Animations and Effects:
- Smooth transitions between quests.
- Subtle animations for flowers, butterflies, and environment.
- Fireworks made of flower petals for the final scene.
- Fade in/out effects for messages and UI.

6. Accessibility:
- Ensure tap targets are large enough.
- Use ARIA roles and labels where appropriate.

7. Dependent Files:
- Only index.html will be used for all code (HTML, CSS via CDN, and JavaScript).

8. Follow-up Steps:
- Test on mobile devices or emulators for touch responsiveness.
- Verify quest progression and message display.
- Verify animations and final surprise scene.
- Optimize performance for mobile browsers.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan for implementation.
